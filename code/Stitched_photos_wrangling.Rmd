## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
stitched_photos_batched= read_csv(here("data/stitched_photos_batched.csv"))

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}

stitched_data= stitched_photos_batched %>%
  group_by(image, length, surface, volume)%>%
  summarize(sum_root_length=(sum(length)), sum_root_surface= (sum(surface)), sum_root_volume=(sum(volume)))
  
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
